## 📝 Project Overview
EasyStore is a high-end Full-Stack marketplace designed to solve the "Trust Gap" in the Ethiopian digital economy. It bridges the gap between local banking (CBE/Oromia Bank) and modern e-commerce by integrating a cloud-based receipt verification system. Every product series is hand-picked to ensure quality for customers in **Finfinnee (Addis Ababa)** and beyond.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **📦 Brand Series Catalog:** Grouped product logic (e.g., Lenovo, iPhone) allowing users to choose from multiple models/colors in a single interactive view.
- **📈 Dynamic Sales Analytics:** Automated backend logic that increments "Bought Last Month" counters in real-time upon successful checkout.
- **⭐ Interactive Rating System:** Real-time calculation of weighted average ratings based on unique user feedback.
- **🏦 Secure CBE/Bank Integration:** Automatic permanent cloud storage of payment screenshots using the **Cloudinary API**.
- **✅ Confident Success UI:** A professional "Green Success Page" that confirms delivery details instantly to the customer.
- **📱 Ultra-Responsive Design:** Mobile-first UI built with Glassmorphism, tailored for devices like Tecno, Infinix, and iPhone.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
### Frontend
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Custom-built "Ultra-Beauty" theme using **Plus Jakarta Sans** and modern CSS Grid/Flexbox.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Pure JS logic for state management, bag handling, and API communication.
- **FontAwesome:** For professional iconography.

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express.js:** RESTful API architecture.
